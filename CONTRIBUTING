Contributing to this project requires acceptance of the terms outlined
in the Developer Certificate of Origin in the DCO file.

Any merge request, issue posts, commit, or any other content development
on this project legally constitutes signed acceptance of the terms in
the DCO, meaning that any contribution to this project -- in any way --
releases any legal claim on those contributions including copyright,
patents, trademarks, and any other intellectual property rights. It is
the responsibility of all would-be contributors to legally ensure that
they indeed have those rights themselves to release in the first place
(and that those that employ them agree).

Too often developers do not realize they have signed away their rights
to contribute without express permission when they accept employment for
a particular organization. Better safe than sorry. Do the research to
find out.
