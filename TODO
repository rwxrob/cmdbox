## TODO

Here's some stuff we know I want to add but haven't made issues or time for yet:

* move to 1.16, root out deprecated `ioutil`
* fix broken subcommands of subcommands with tab completion and usage
* support `<file>` syntax formatting rendered as all caps upper without
  the angle brackets and underlined, or just leave if no support in
  terminal for underlining to make compatible visually with man pages
* recursive `usage` building by combining `x.Usage` into one line
* better color terminal detection and support, configurable
* `_help_md` - output a markdown file containing doc info
* `_help_html` - output a standalone HTML5 document with doc info
* `_help_http` - serves the `_help_html` document locally
* internal paging when `less` not found (`go-pager`?)
* assume use of the standard logger `log`, trap and beautify output
