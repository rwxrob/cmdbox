# All Commands in One File

This sample puts all commands into a single file and reuses a common
`x` variable of type `*Command` to simplify the syntax.

Add bash completion with `complete -C hi hi` (or the equivalent at
`./hi` depending on how you are building/installing).

Run the program without any options to see the automatically generated
help documentation.
